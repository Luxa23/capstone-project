# my recipes

## `Description`

"my recipes" is an app developed as capstone project for the [neuefische](https://www.neuefische.de/) web development bootcamp.

The app can be thought of as a personal recipe collection irrespective of the recipes' sources. These days recipes are everywhere: in books, magazines, online or they come from colleagues, friends or family. "my recipes" helps to keep all those recipes together in a single app. Users can create recipes and choose the origin (book, website, other). In the case of "other" it is possible to enter the ingredients and cooking instructions. Recipes can be found via a title search.
